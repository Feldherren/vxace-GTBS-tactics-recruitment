vxace-GTBS-tactics-recruitment
==============================

Making VXAce work with Fomar's Clone Actor script to recruit enemies like FFT or Tactics Ogre; instead of normally recruiting a single copy of an actor with the 'invite' or 'capture' functions of GTBS, you can now recruit unlimited copies of them!

Currently just replaces GTBS' normal usage of add_actor in add_remove_invited() with creating a clone, adding that to the party and customising it to match the enemy's name and level.
Will eventually have support for equipment items, too.

Requires: GTBS, Fomar's Clone Actor script
